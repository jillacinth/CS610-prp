# CS610-prp
You are asked to create a program that stores English words using a structure called a Lexicon, which includes a Hash Table and an Array. The Hash Table will use a technique called open-addressing with quadratic probing for collision resolution. The Hash Table will only store pointers to the words in the Array, which will contain all the words. When a new word is added, it is hashed and stored in the Hash Table with a pointer to its location in the Array. If a word is deleted, it is removed from the Hash Table, but it remains in the Array as garbage. The program should support functions to create the Lexicon, print its contents, check if it is empty or full, insert, delete, and search for words, and perform batch operations on a file containing commands. The batch file should include commands to insert, delete, search, print, and create the Lexicon with a specified size.
